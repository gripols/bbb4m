\begin{definition}[Globalization]
The process whereby national or regional economies and 
cultures have become integrated through many methods,
such as foreign direct investment, international trade, migration, 
new forms of transportation, and the flow of money. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{History of Globalization (not on test)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Began after WWII with the establishment of the United Nations and fostering of trade relations between countries.
    \item Economic ties between countries strengthened -- tax treaties were negotiated, tariffs abolished, global corporations developed
    \item New technology allows international business to occur in real time, transforming the globe into one market.
    \item Has increased interdependence of all nations, blurring political boundaries
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Interdependence]
    The reliance of two or more nations on each other for products or services.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Three Main Areas of Interdependence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary industries
    \item Secondary industries 
    \item Tertiary industries
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Multiplier Effect]
    When an entity (such as the government, businesses, or individuals) spends money, 
    it generates income for others, who in turn spend that income, creating a ripple 
    effect through the economy.
